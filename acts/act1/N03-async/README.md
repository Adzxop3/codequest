# N03: Async Programming

## Learning Objectives
- Master Promises, async/await syntax
- Handle asynchronous operations and error handling
- Practice concurrent programming patterns

## Challenge
Implement asynchronous functions that manage timing, API calls, and concurrent operations.

## Instructions
1. Complete the functions in `solution.js`
2. Run `node test.js` to validate your implementation
3. Use `cq validate` to check your progress

## Bonus Criteria
- Implement Promise.all and Promise.race patterns
- Handle concurrent operations efficiently
- Proper error handling with try/catch

## Files
- `solution.js` - Your implementation
- `test.js` - Test suite
- `hints.json` - Available hints
