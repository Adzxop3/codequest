# N01: Functions & Scope

## Learning Objectives
- Master function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions
- Understand scope, closures, and hoisting
- Practice higher-order functions

## Challenge
Build functions that demonstrate advanced function concepts and scope management.

## Instructions
1. Complete the functions in `solution.js`
2. Run `node test.js` to validate your implementation
3. Use `cq validate` to check your progress

## Bonus Criteria
- Use closures effectively
- Implement higher-order functions
- Demonstrate understanding of `this` binding

## Files
- `solution.js` - Your implementation
- `test.js` - Test suite
- `hints.json` - Available hints
